The two ‘-realm.json’ files contain the configuration for Keycloak. This includes the OAuth 2 client(s) as well as all users that can log in. As our Keycloak Docker container is not initialized when we start it, we use this files to configure it automatically.

The sqs-queue-definition.conf file contains the AWS queue definition(s). We describe which queues are available and should be initialized upon starting the container.

We Docker, we usually get fresh and “empty” containers and hence have to initialize them properly.
